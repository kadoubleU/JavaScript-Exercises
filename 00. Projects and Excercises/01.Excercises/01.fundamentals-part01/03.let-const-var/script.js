// LECTURE: Data Types
// 1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable 'language', but don't assign it any value yet
// 2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language' to the console

//------------------------------------------------------------

// Excercise 1: Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable language', but don't assign it any value yet

// let isIsland = false;
// let language;

//From Previous Excercise 

// let country = "Bulgaria";
// let continent = "Europe";
// let population = "6.8";

//-----------------------------------------------------------

// Excercise 2: Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language' to the console

// console.log(typeof isIsland);
// console.log(typeof population);
// console.log(typeof language);

// LECTURE: let, const and var
// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens



// Excercise 1: Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live.

language = "Bulgarian";

// Excercise 2: Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.


const isIsland = false;
const country = "Bulgaria";
const continent = "Europe";

// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens

country = "England";
